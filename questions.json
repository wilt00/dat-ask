      ],
      "explanation": [
        "This question requires that you remember the formula for butane and how to create a combustion reaction. First, you have to know that butane has 4 carbons. Then you can use the (2×n)+2 rule to find the number of hydrogens – in this case 10 hydrogens.",
        "To remember the amount of carbons in the major hydrocarbons, use the mnemonic \"Men Eat Peanut Butter\", or \"methane (1 carbon), ethane (2 carbons), propane (3 carbons), butane (4 carbons)\".",
        "The following equation is needed for this question:\nC4H10 + O2 -> H2O + CO2\n",
        "To balance this equation, a 2 should be placed in front of C4H10 to make it easier to balance:\n2 C4H10 + O2 -> H2O + CO2",
        "Next, an 8 must be placed on the right side in front of CO2 to balance the carbons:\n2 C4H10 + O2 -> H2O + 8 CO2",
        "Next, a 10 must be placed on the right side, in front of H2O to balance the hydrogens:\n2 C4H10 + O2 -> 10 H2O + 8 CO2",
        "Finally, a 13 must be placed on the left side, in front of O2 to balance oxygen.\n\n2 C4H10 + 13 O2 -> 10 H2O + 8 CO2",

      "explanation": [
        "Transport proteins are often used by many substrates while channel proteins are generally used by ions. Both of these types of proteins have a large variety in their shapes, sizes, and complexities. Therefore, no generalization can be made about them. Many transport proteins can use passive transport as well via uniport, for example.",

      "question": "A scientist translates an enzyme from pre-processed cell mRNA in a test tube (in vitro). However, the in vitro enzyme is found to be inactive compared to the extracted in vivo enzyme from a live cell culture. Which statement is the LEAST likely explanation for this phenomenon?",

      "alts": [
        "The extracted mRNA contains introns, which were translated as well.",
        "The in vitro enzyme was not phosphorylated.",

        "Molecular chaperones were not present in vitro to properly fold the enzyme."
      ],
      "explanation": [
        "This is a great example of a comprehension DAT biology question. All of the answer choices are plausible, but only one stands out like a sore thumb. A nonsense mutation leads to a premature stop codon in the mRNA, halting translation and the production of the protein, which would lead to a lack of activity. However, this is the least likely situation, as mutations are already very rare. It is much more likely that one of the other scenarios occurred.",
        "Leaving the introns (the non-coding regions of the DNA) in the mRNA would destroy the intended enzyme by not allowing it to properly fold, leading to inactivation. Introns are normally removed as mRNA is processed through the nucleus, directly extracting “pre-processed” mRNA would likely leave the introns in place. This is why scientists often use cDNA, or complementary DNA, which is the intended gene sans introns and can be directly translated.",
        "Most enzymes also undergo post-translational modifications to become active, such as phosphorylation or get cleaved at a specific environment to control their activity. This is especially useful in the production of pepsin in the stomach; producing an inactive version of pepsin (pepsinogen) allows us to control the activity of the enzyme so it does not end up eating the cell that produced it!",

        "Both of the brothers are phenotypically identical in regards to their hair texture. Genotypically, the two are different, as one is homozygous dominant and the other is heterozygous for hair texture. Despite the genotype differences the brothers are phenotypically similar with their hair texture because the dominant allele is the one being expressed. In both the case of Hh and HH, the presence of the dominant allele results in straight hair. This is due to complete dominance.",
        "In incomplete dominance, the heterozygote phenotypically is a hybrid between the two parents (i.e. a red and white flower make a pink flower). Whereas with codominance the heterozygote is phenotypically like both parents, i.e. red and white flower makes white plant with red spots. Law of independent assortment and law of segregation refer to Mendelian genetics, but are not the explanations for the phenotypic similarity between the two genotypes."
